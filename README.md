Approval [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nikolavp/approval.png)](http://travis-ci.org/nikolavp/approval)
==================
Approval is an open source assertion/verification library to aid unit testing. The current project is using ideas from [ApprovalTests](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Java) but should provide a more up to date java feel to it. Note that the project is in an early stage and the API might change(there is still no 1.0 version).

What can it be used for?
---

Approval can be used for verifing objects that require more than a simple assert. The idea is that you sometimes just want to verify a particular result at the end and then start implementation refactoring. I like to call it "I will know the right result when I see it". Usecases for this might be:

- performance improvements to the implementation while preserving the current system output
- just verifying RESTful response results, be it JSON, XML, HTML whatever
- people use it for TDD but instead of providing the result upfront you just implement the simple possible thing, verify the result and then start improving the implementation.

Dependencies
---
Currently there are no dependencies for this project. Although at some point I might add guava because programming in java without it is such a pain.

Issues?
---
You can just write a bug report or even better send a pull request with a patch. Patches are gladly accepted.


TODO?
---
* A proper website for the project that is generated by maven
* Proper documentation although the code is small and readable by now

Development
----------
Writing the documentation is super easy. Justt install sphinx-autobuild and run:
```
sphinx-autobuild -b html doc/source doc/build/html
```
